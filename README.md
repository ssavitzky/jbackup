# jbackup: lj/dw journal download tool



`jbackup` was obtained from 
https://github.com/dreamwidth/dw-free/blob/master/src/jbackup/jbackup.pl 

In its original state it is a single file in the
https://github.com/dreamwidth/dw-free/ repository, and was last edited in
2013, (commit 9ac1042) when it was imported from lj.  It requires the
`libxmlrpc-lite-perl` and `libterm-readkey-perl` packages.  The plan is to
make it import in a format compatible with whatever my current blog archive
format is or may become.
